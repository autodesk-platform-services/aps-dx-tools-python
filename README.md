## Description
This is a Python sample, created in form of a CLI tool that helps to automate the process of reading and creating exchanges from ACC.
The code was build in a such way that the included `data_exchange` lib can be easily reused in other projects.

### Dependencies
* **Python**: Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). **It is required to use Python > 3.13**. 
* **APS Account**: Learn how to create an APS Account, activate subscription and create an app at [this tutorial](https://tutorials.autodesk.io/#create-an-account).


## Running locally
The Data Exchange calls requires 3-legged authenticated token. 
To simplify the sample and have only the minimum necessary code focused on Data Exchange, the Authentication code is missing.
To run the sample, it is required to have the 3-legged authenticated token and set the `AUTH_TOKEN` var within [config.py](/config.py) file.

Within the project folder:

1. Create a virtual environment:
```commandline
    python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

For Windows:
```commandline
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
For Linux/MacOS systems:
```commandline
    source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies via pip:
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. The app can be called by running
```
    python main.py
```

or you can set an alias:

For Windows PowerShell:
```commandline
    function dx-tools { python 'C:\<path>\aps-dx-tools-python\main.py' @args }
```
To make the alias permanent, add the function to your PowerShell profile (`$PROFILE`).

For Linux/MacOS systems:
```commandline
    alias dx-tools="python3 main.py"
```
To make the alias permanent, add it to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

and call the app with further commands:

```commandline
dx-tools gethubs
```

For the entire list of commands check [the documentation for the app](./docs.md).

## Knowing issues

- For brevity purpose, the error handling is missing from the code and almost all errors will default to `"ERROR: The Auth token expired"`
